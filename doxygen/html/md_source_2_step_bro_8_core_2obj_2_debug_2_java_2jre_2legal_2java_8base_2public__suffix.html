<div class="line">--------------</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically</div>

<div class="line">Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such</div>
<div class="line">Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an</div>
<div class="line">ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the</div>
<div class="line">non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have</div>
<div class="line">come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular</div>
<div class="line">Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor</div>
<div class="line">notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the</div>
<div class="line">first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License</div>
<div class="line">from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after</div>
<div class="line">Your receipt of the notice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,</div>
<div class="line">counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version</div>
<div class="line">directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to</div>
<div class="line">You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section</div>
<div class="line">2.1 of this License shall terminate.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all</div>
<div class="line">end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which</div>
<div class="line">have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License</div>
<div class="line">prior to termination shall survive termination.</div>
